# Meetapp API

This is the API used to serve data for the APP mobile and WEB versions, builded with node + express used for certification on bootcamp by Rocketseat.

# Installation

Make sure you already have node and yarn installed, you can read documentations before get started. Then use the package manager for install dependencies.

```bash
$ yarn
```
This API is configured by default to use ``mysql`` database, but you can read Sequelize documentation to install any other sql database.



## Redis

Please install Redis on your machine to run jobs on the backend.
If you have docker installed please create a container with:

```sh
$ docker run --name redismeetup -p 6379:6379 -d -t redis:alpine
```
